# Autonomous Changelog

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-014

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-011

- Task ID: AUTO-011
- Summary: Added `docs/RUN_SUMMARIES.md` documenting the future local run-summary format, required fields, example preview, and safety limits that prevent automatic history-file writes until explicitly planned.

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-010

- Task ID: AUTO-010
- Summary: Added `docs/COMMANDS.md` documenting implemented CLI command purposes, inputs, expected human-readable output patterns, exit-code expectations, and safety limitations; linked the command contracts from README.
- Validation completed: Static documentation review completed against AUTO-010 acceptance criteria; runtime test execution was unavailable in this automation environment.
- Commit hash: pending final commit lookup
- Follow-up notes: Proceed to AUTO-011 next so local run-summary format work can be designed without adding execution behavior.

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-009

- Task ID: AUTO-009
- Summary: Added read-only roadmap structure linting through `forge lint-plan`, including required task fields, supported priority values, supported status values, CLI diagnostics, tests, and README usage notes.
- Validation completed: Static implementation review completed against AUTO-009 acceptance criteria; added unit and CLI coverage for valid plans, missing required fields, unsupported priorities, and unsupported statuses; runtime test execution was unavailable in this automation environment.
- Commit hash: pending final commit lookup
- Follow-up notes: Proceed to AUTO-010 next so command output contracts are documented after the new read-only command exists.

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-008

- Task ID: AUTO-008
- Summary: Extended the read-only `forge report` output to include repository policy readiness as present/readable, missing, or malformed while avoiding any path enforcement claims.
- Validation completed: Static implementation review completed against AUTO-008 acceptance criteria; added CLI coverage for present, missing, and malformed policy states; runtime test execution was unavailable in this automation environment.
- Commit hash: pending final commit lookup
- Follow-up notes: Proceed to AUTO-009 next so roadmap structure can be linted before adding more commands.

## 2026-07-07 — AUTO-007

- Task ID: AUTO-007
- Summary: Added conservative read-only parsing for `.forge/policy.md`, exposed a `forge policy` summary command, documented the command, and added parser/CLI coverage for valid, missing, and malformed policy inputs.
- Validation completed: Static implementation review completed against the documented policy format; runtime test execution was unavailable in this automation environment.
- Commit hash: pending final commit lookup
- Follow-up notes: Proceed to AUTO-008 next so `forge report` can surface policy readiness without claiming enforcement.

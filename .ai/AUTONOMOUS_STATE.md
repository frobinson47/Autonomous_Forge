# Autonomous State

- Current roadmap version: v1
- Current task ID: AUTO-004
- Current task status: DONE
- Current branch: main
- Last run timestamp: 2026-07-07T05:58:43+04:00
- Last successful commit hash: pending final commit lookup
- Latest run summary: Added a read-only dry-run repository report command that summarizes roadmap task counts, next eligible task, state-file availability, and suggested validation.
- Files changed in the latest run: README.md, src/autonomous_forge/report.py, src/autonomous_forge/cli.py, tests/test_report.py, tests/test_cli.py, .ai/AUTONOMOUS_PLAN.md, .ai/AUTONOMOUS_STATE.md, .ai/AUTONOMOUS_CHANGELOG.md.
- Validation commands and results: Static review completed for report builder, CLI flow, and tests. Runtime execution of `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest` was not available in this automation environment.
- Current blockers: Runtime test execution is unavailable in this automation environment.
- Known risks and assumptions: The report is intentionally read-only and only reads plan and state files.
- Recommended next task: AUTO-005 — Document repository policy format.
